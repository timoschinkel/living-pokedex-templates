# Living Pokédex templates

I'm not ashamed to admit I still like to play [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/). And as I'm a bit of a [completionist](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/completionist) I like to achieve a [living Pokédex](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pok%C3%A9dex) in every game I play.

This repository is a helping hand in organizing my living Pokédex. For now the only supported Pokédex is for the [Galar region](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Galar). I hope to expand this to all regions later.
